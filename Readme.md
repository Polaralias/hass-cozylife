## What is it

This a third-party home assistant custom components works for Cozylife Lights based on [the official repository](https://github.com/cozylife/hass_cozylife_local_pull). The official repo is buggy in too many ways. This one heavily modified. 

* It is a pure local version and does not use UDP discovery.

* The color temperature is fixed.


## features

* heartbeat to each bulb in a fix time interval to test the availability. Even if the bulb is not available during the time of setup or later, it can pick it up if the bulb goes online again.
* async
* fixed the color temperature


## Tested Product 

Tested it on [color bulbs (no homekit)](https://detail.1688.com/offer/617699711703.html?spm=a2615.2177701.autotrace-offerGeneral.1.12be5799WNMB96).
It can be initialized though bluetooth. 

It has also been tested on [color bulbs (with homekit)](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001365774507.html). It can run both Apple homekit and Home Assistant simultaneously.

Switch and CW lights are not tested yet.
CW lights should work.

## Setup

The integration now supports Home Assistant's config flow so you no longer need to edit `configuration.yaml` or run the standalone `getconfig.py` script. After installing the custom component:

1. Open **Settings â†’ Devices & Services** in Home Assistant.
2. Click **Add Integration** and search for **CozyLife**.
3. Provide the start and end IP addresses of the range you want to scan (for example, the DHCP range used by your bulbs) and optionally adjust the TCP timeout.
4. The onboarding flow will probe the devices directly from Home Assistant and create a config entry containing all discovered lights and switches.

The device list can be refreshed at any time from the integration's options menu, where the same scan form is available. YAML configuration is no longer supported and the discovery workflow now happens entirely inside Home Assistant.

## How I Setup the bulb

The bulb will phone home to dohome.doiting.com. I blocked the dns request (you might also be able to block the internet access entirely, have not tested). This makes the registration process half complete.
But the app could transmit the wifi name and password to the bulb.
In principle, if you complete the full registration with the cloud, the bulb will respond to UDP discovery.
However, my bulbs does not respond to UDP discovery, not sure if is because the code I used was buggy.

Instead, the integration performs a TCP scan on the operating port 5555 across the IP range you specify during configuration.

Note that we must have persistent IP addresses otherwise the config will change. This can be done on most routers.

### Optional requirements

[Circadian Lighting](https://github.com/claytonjn/hass-circadian_lighting)

I used a modified v1 version (with Astral v2 dependance). v2 is not tested.

## Notes and todo

* Nothing is encrypted. If it talks to the cloud, I guess it also talks to the cloud unencrypted. In the file model.json, even the ota update file is not encrypted. If someone could crack it. One might be able to flash custom firmware via OTA.

* Implement effects, the formats are listed below

* The color is not accurate at all (to be fixed? I am not sensitive to colors).

### summary for control parameters:

* '1': on off switch
* '2': 0 normal change to color / color temperature with a transition period

* '2': 1 with special effects
* '4': brightness
* '5': hue
* '6': saturation
* '8': speed of change
* '7': consists of two bits of operator and 7 colors

* colors are in the format of HHHH SSSS TTTT
where HHHH SSSS are hue and saturation.
TTTT is color temperature.
* In color mode, TTTT=FFFF.
* In white mode, HHHH SSSS =FFFF FFFF.

### operator code for effects:

#### List (applicable to color or color temperature, or a mix of the two)


04: 1 on off rotation
05: 2 on off rotation
06: 3 on off rotation
07: 7 on off rotation

08: 1 slowly diming
09: 2 slowly diming
0a: 3 slowly diming
0b: 7 slowly diming

0c: 1 fast flash
0d: 2 fast flash
0e: 3 fast flash
0f: 7 fast flash

#### Only for color 

00: 1 smooth change color rotation 
01: 2 smooth change color rotation 
02: 3 smooth change color rotation
03: 7 smooth change color rotation (rainbow effects)

#### Note for color temperature

00: brief dim and increase back up '8' does not matter, 01 FFFF FFFF TTTT.
01: identical to mode '2':0, but it is a sudden change instead of a smooth transition.
